Attempt 9,"Full working smartHome workflow, apart from one added wire.
Provided titles for change nodes. Set the original volume to a flow variable and retrieved it.","gemini-1.5-pro-001","Temperature = 0
Top-P = 0
JSON output"
Attempt 6,"Working workflow
Values set to msg.payload were off, but were consistently formatted so could be fixed","Google Gemini-1.5-flash-001","Temperature = 0
Top-P = 0"
Attempt7,"Attempted full system.
Correct logical presentation of nodes, with distinct sub-workflows.
Failed to provide “change” node to edit the payload within most sub-workflows.","Google Gemini-1.5-flash-001","Temperature = 0
Top-P = 0"
Attempt 5,"Complete failure (by default)

Almost correct (after ID edits)
Only missing one node. Performed better than most humans.","Google Gemini-1.5-flash-001","Temperature = 0
Top-P = 0"
Attempt 8,"Mostly logical output
Missing payload changes
One area of strange generation","gemini-1.5-pro-001","Temperature = 0
Top-P = 0
JSON output"
Attempt2,Promising half sub-flow created (almost identical to those made by humans in experimentation),meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Through HuggingChat,
Attempt3,Logically correct but failed to correctly alter node inputs,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Using python and HuggingFace inference client,
Attempt 4,"Very limited response.
Used the correct system nodes but did not input values to them.
Also failed to connect nodes properly (putting them in parallel not series, or not connecting them at all).
Allowed many input tokens, so prompts may be altered.
Usable JSON was produced with no errors from escape strings.","Google Gemini-1.5-flash-001","Temperature = 0
Top-P = 1"
Attempt 1,Prompts too long,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Through HuggingChat,
