"requestWaterConditions, accessCameraFeed, forceFoodDispense",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"3a, 3b, 4, 5","Thing definition error (user made) - receiveWaterConditions does not have input parameters so this had to be assumed by the model.

Due to the assumptive nature of affordance coupled with the fact that access to undefined “msg” properties will return “undefined”, the model’s output is not unreasonable. It does however assume that the client’s device is expecting multiple calls to “receiveWaterConditions” for each water attribute.",Smart Aquarium
