Monitor temperature, wind speed, and rainfall. If any of these conditions exceed safe thresholds for the preservation of artifacts, the system alerts the site manager and adjusts onsite environmental control systems accordingly.

If an artifact is moved without authorization, the system alerts security personnel.

If intrusion to the dig site is detected, the system alerts security personnel and initiates appropriate security procedures.

Drones equipped with cameras and ground-penetrating radar help in identifying potential excavation sites. The data collected by the drones is analyzed and the results are sent to the archaeologists for review.

Sensors monitor the structural integrity of ancient structures and underground chambers. If any potential weak points or damage are detected, the system alerts the site manager and schedules a detailed inspection by the inspection team.

If a visitor enters a restricted area, the system alerts security personnel.

If any equipment malfunctions or requires maintenance, the system alerts the maintenance team.

All research data collected at the site is sent to a central processing unit for analysis. The results are then shared with the research team and stored in a database for future reference.

In case of an emergency, such as a fire or earthquake all users of the system are alerted.
