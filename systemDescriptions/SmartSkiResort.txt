If temperature, wind speed, or snowfall indicate a potential risk for skiers. If there is a minor risk of avalanches display warnings on digital signage across the resort. If there is a major risk, alert the resort management and close all slopes.

If an avalanche is detected, the system immediately alerts the resort management and close off affected slopes as well as dispatching the rescue team, and stopping lifts near the affected area.

If a slope becomes too crowded, the system alerts the resort management, who can then take measures to redirect skiers to less crowded slopes.

Allow rentals to be made for 3 days. If rented equipment is not returned within the given time, send a notification to the customer that made the rental order to prompt them to return the equipment. After that, give the customer 1 hour to return the equipment. If the equipment is still not returned alert the rental shop.

If a skier presses the emergency button on their resort-provided wearable device, the system alerts the resort's medical team and provides them with the skier's location.

If a lift malfunctions, the system alerts the maintenance team and initiates repair procedures.

Allow guests to query real-time information about weather conditions, slope traffic, and lift wait times.

If the resort’s energy usage exceeds a certain threshold, the system alerts the facilities manager and lowers the resort’s heating or lighting systems to conserve energy.
