When oxygen levels drop below a certain threshold, alert the control center and initiate emergency oxygen supply.

Monitor temperature and humidity levels in all modules. If any module’s temperature or humidity deviates from the set range, adjust the environmental control system accordingly and alert the crew.

If a fire is detected, alert the crew, initiate fire suppression systems, and seal off the affected module.

Use sensors to monitor the structural integrity of the space station. If any damage or potential weak points are detected, alert the control center and the crew.

If major damage to a module is detected, schedule a spacewalk for the astronauts.

If communication with the ground control is lost, switch to the backup communication system. If the backup system also fails, deploy an emergency communication beacon.

Monitor the health and status of all communication devices. If any device malfunctions, alert the crew and initiate repair procedures.

All research equipment reports their data to the central processing unit for analysis. The results are then sent to the crew’s devices and the ground control.
