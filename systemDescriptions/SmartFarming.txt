When moisture in the field drops below a threshold, the system triggers irrigation to ensure optimal crop hydration. Once a sufficient moisture level has been reached the irrigation system will be disabled.

The irrigation schedule should be adjusted based on the temperature, humidity and wind speed of the fields.

Images from crop analysis drones will be analyzed to assess crop health.

Based on crop imaging results, the system calculates precise fertilizer requirements. Automated dispensers apply fertilizers only where needed, based on the calculated fertiliser requirements.

The vital signs of livestock will be measured and alerts sent to the farmers if anomalies are detected.

If an animal strays beyond predefined field boundaries, the system will alert the farmers.

Dispense feed only when an animals need it, ensuring consistent nutrition for livestock.

If signs of distress are observed from livestock, the system notifies the farmers, the veterinarian will also be alerted for major distress.

If the greenhouse temperature is too high turn on the air conditioning. If the greenhouse temperature is too low turn on the heater. If the temperature is in a safe range turn off the air conditioning and the heater.

When there is too much light in the greenhouse, shade the windows. If there is not enough light in the greenhouse, remove the shade.

If the humidity of the greenhouse is too high open the windows, close the windows if the humidity lowers too much.

Farmers will be able to access current real-time data on crop health, livestock status, and environmental conditions.
